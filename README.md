Hi Johnny,

How are you? Hope you are doing well.
This message from Nikolay, we cooperated on Upwork. Sorry that I disturb you, but you don't reply on my messages on Upwork.
Johnny, I have to ask you to close our current contract, if you don't mind, of course. The main reason is that open contracts without activity may decrease my rating on the UpWork platform that may negatively affect finding new jobs. Hope for your understanding.
In any case, I'm really happy to work with you. 

Thank you very much.

Kind regards,
Nikolay.


# Tarzan Pet Tracker

## Motivation
I wanted to create my own GPS tracker for my pet puppy since he's a little escape artist. I saw the prices of dog trackers and the subscription costs includes and thought `Noooope`. So I opted to make my own, and learn more about Flutter and how to make my own iot project. The tracker itself is made of a Raspberry Pi Zero, with a battery, GPS and Sim Module attached. Coordinates are uploaded to Firestore using NodeJS on the PiZero.
